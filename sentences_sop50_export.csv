review of franchise license dealer jobber or similar agreements
the discussion in this section applies to franchise agreements license agreements dealer agreements with the exception of dealer agreements from new car manufacturers which are not reviewed for affiliation jobber or similar agreements
all such franchise license dealer jobber or similar agreements are referred to in this section as franchise agreements and the two parties to any such agreement are referred to as
franchisor and franchisee
finding that the agreement is acceptable under this section means that the agreement does not impose unacceptable control provisions on the small business applicant which would result in affiliation
the fact that the agreement is acceptable does not mean that the small business applicant is eligible therefore lender must consider all other size eligibility and underwriting requirements specific to respective loan applicant application in accordance with this sop applicants who operate or propose to operate under franchise development agreements often referred to as master franchise agreements are ineligible as such agreements have been determined to be inherently speculative and are considered to be passive investments
development agreements may include but are not limited to a agreements which provide the developer geographic area with which to grow additional franchise units and agreements where the developer income is derived from the royalty payments of each franchise unit in the developer geographic territory

control by franchisor either directly or through an affiliated entity or agent such that the franchisee does not have the independent right to profit from its efforts and bear the risk of loss commensurate with ownership
review of franchise agreements and related documents sba requires in all cases determination as to whether affiliation exists when the applicant has or will have franchise license dealer jobber or similar relationship and such relationship or product service or trademark covered by such relationship is critical to the small business applicant business operation
in such case the agreement governing the relationship or product service or trademark and any related documents must be reviewed
review and determination must be conducted by ii
sba for all loans processed through the lgpc including clp lender for plp sba express or any other delegated processing method except that delegated lenders also have the option of submitting franchise agreement documentation to sba for an affiliation determination
in such case the documentation must be sent to delegatedfranchisereviews sba gov
sba will notify the lender of its determination after completing its review
if sba determines that the parties are not affiliated based on the agreement and any supplemental documentation the lender may continue to process the application under its delegated authority
in all cases the franchise agreement including any amendments and or addendums must be executed by all parties prior to first disbursement
if the application is submitted to the lgpc for processing the lender must also submit certification signed by the franchisor that it will provide the franchisee with any approved sba addendum which upon execution by the franchisee will supplement the franchise documents and be binding on the franchisor
if lender disburses the proceeds without obtaining the necessary executed franchise documents including any amendments and or addendums sba may deny liability on its guaranty
registry of approved franchise agreements to facilitate the review of these agreements sba makes available list of franchise agreements the registry that have been approved by the sba franchise committee for size affiliation and control issues
this information is currently available to the public at no cost at www franchiseregistry com
sba also posts list of approved agreements by year on sba website at www sba gov for lenders
lender must ensure that they have the correct date of the agreement that the applicant franchisee is operating under in order to access the correct registry documents
if lender is unable to determine the date from the documents it should contact the franchisor directly
sba will accept the effective date january sop f subpart executed certification of franchise documents available on the registry website matching the correct year of the agreement as conclusive evidence that the franchisee is not affiliated with the franchisor based upon the agreement
affiliation may nevertheless exist based on other factors
in order to rely on the registry for its determination the lender loan file must include the following a executed franchise agreement and any approved attachments and exhibits b executed addendum if required executed certification of franchise documents and compliance with any required eligibility notes
process if not listed on registry or lender is not using the registry if the franchise agreement is not listed on the registry or the lender chooses not to use the registry review must be made of the agreement and all related documents
franchise findings lenders should consult the sba franchise findings list at http www sba gov content franchise findings to see if there have been any findings for particular franchise agreement which if still in the agreement would result in determination of affiliation
the information provided by the sba franchise findings list should be used by lenders to ensure they are making informed affiliation determinations
lenders should consult the fix available
category on the findings list to see if there is fix to remedy the specific issues noted on the findings list
noted findings remain in the agreement then the agreement should be determined to result in affiliation
sba chief franchise counsel for specific questions regarding franchise affiliation determinations
franchisors may contact the sba chief franchise counsel at franchiseappeals sba gov for questions regarding the franchise registry approval process
lenders may contact sba counsel in the district office or the if franchise agreement has no negotiated fix available and the ii
affiliation issues to consider if reviewing franchise agreement that is not listed on the registry or if the lender is not using the registry
the following are examples of common situations that should be examined to determine if affiliation exists
january sop f subpart any of the following provisions are considered conclusive evidence of control
including transfer provision that requires franchisor consent must state
consent must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed or its equivalent
sba will not infer this into franchise agreement
reasonable business judgment is not an acceptable substitute
setting the applicant net profit
requiring the payment of excessive franchise continuing fees directly controlling the applicant employees including hiring or terminating
short term step in agreements for days are acceptable provided the period of control by the franchisor does not exceed days in the aggregate over the term of the agreement
in the temporary personnel industry temporary employees paid by the franchisor are acceptable as long as the franchisee makes all employment determinations
requiring that the billing activities deposit receipts or revenues for the applicant be handled by the franchisor or third party chosen by the franchisor exception automatic debits from franchisee account are acceptable
including an option to purchase the applicant personal property upon expiration or breach of the agreement where the franchisor has the ability to control the price at the time of purchase exception right of first refusal is allowed provided it is on commercially reasonable terms
requiring the franchisee or epc owner if applicable to sell the real property to the franchisor upon expiration breach or termination of the agreement
this type of provision may be found in the agreement itself or recorded against the real estate as purchase option
exception the franchisor may however require lease of the property upon termination for period up to the remaining term of the original franchise agreement or effective date january sop f subpart
including right of first refusal on partial transfer of ownership between existing owners of franchise entity or their close relatives
insurance industry sba office of hearings and appeals has determined that in the insurance industry it does not create affiliation for the franchisor to own the insurance policies as well as receive the payments on the policy
fitness industry fitness centers that target one gender are not ineligible if they permit both men and women to join and or use the facility
lenders must document the file with the following affidavit signed by the small business applicant that both men and women are allowed to join and or use the facility and ii
evidence that the facility is open to both men and women such as two single sex bathrooms or locker rooms brochures flyers stating that both men and women are welcome or actual membership demographics
gasoline industry based on the industry standard established by the gasoline industry it is common practice for the oil company to install credit card system to provide for payment of gasoline products
this type of arrangement by itself does not create excessive control or affiliation
most dealer agreements are for term of three years with limited or no renewal terms
in situations where gasoline supplier is leasing the real property to the dealer the petroleum marketing practices act controls and contains detailed provisions on the authority and procedure for non renewal or termination
this type of lease arrangement by itself does not place inappropriate control in the oil company dealer
the eligibility determination for all gas station loans must include review of the relevant documents
the effective date january sop f
subpart documentation associated with gas station loans is voluminous complex and frequently contains provisions that enable an oil company or another non small person to exert significant control over the small business loan applicant resulting in affiliation cfr have significant negative impact on the marketability and collateral value of the property and impair the applicant repayment ability
therefore all relevant documents must be reviewed to determine whether single provision or based on the totality of the circumstances cfr execution of the relevant documents by the small business would render it ineligible for sba financial assistance
for purposes of this paragraph the term relevant documents includes but is not limited to the report containing the preliminary results of search of the title to the property including the documents listed in the abstract of title hereafter the title report the small business concern oil company supply agreement and convenience store franchise agreement if any and if the loan is to purchase the property all purchase and sale documents including the exhibits addendums amendments etc
hereafter the purchase and sale documents
while titles vary examples of relevant documents that must be reviewed include the real estate sale agreement terms and conditions of sale contract escrow instructions escrow agreement franchise agreement contract dealer gasoline agreement branded reseller agreement memorandum of gasoline agreement for dealer owner franchisee operated facility branded gas sales restriction and covenant special warranty deed bill of sale use restriction addendum right of first refusal agreement repurchase option subordination agreement environmental release environmental declaration environmental matters remediation and indemnification addendum and site access agreement
subordination is not sufficient to overcome the unacceptable results of objectionable provisions that are of record or to be recorded
this is because to clear the title sba lien would need to be foreclosed and doing so would prevent the small business concern from selling the gas station as going concern and significantly diminish sba recovery in the event of default
examples of unacceptable document review findings i affiliation
provisions in the relevant documents that give an oil company or another non small person significant control over the small business applicant are not acceptable
examples include purchase or repurchase options
purchase or repurchase options that allow an oil company or other person to acquire the small business concern primary business asset g real estate if the small business concern violates condition covenant restriction or other provision
distinction purchase option is different from effective date january sop f subpart right of first refusal
right of first refusal that allows an oil company or other person to match third party offer is generally acceptable to sba
please note that right of first refusal on partial transfer of an interest in the small business concern is not acceptable deed use restrictions
provisions that give an oil company or other person the right to record deed or use restrictions that enable the oil company or other person to control the use of the property thereby preventing the small business owner from fully benefiting commensurate with ownership
note that certain deed restrictions pertaining to the use of the property which are intended to protect the health and safety of occupants may be acceptable
examples of uses in deed restrictions based upon environmental concerns which may be acceptable may include residential use use as day care center for children or seniors use as school or use as hospital
ii significant impairment of collateral value or repayment ability
provisions in the relevant documents that impose requirements restrictions or consequences that could significantly impair the collateral value and marketability of the property or the small business concern repayment ability are not acceptable
the fact that the collateral will consist solely of personal property such as buildings and trade fixtures located on leased land is irrelevant since they would ordinarily be sold in place in the event of foreclosure g a carwash mini mart or fuel pumping equipment
examples include deed restrictions covenants easements reversionary interests and other provisions that restrict the use of the property for the benefit of the seller an oil company or any other person such as those that restrict the brand of fuel that can be sold on the property or require subsequent owners of the property to indemnify an oil company or other person and engineering controls that require the small business concern or subsequent owners to install costly devices or structures such as extraction wells or subsurface barrier walls prior to constructing building remodeling or otherwise improving the property
iii alteration of sba lender legal rights remedies or responsibilities
provisions in the relevant documents that alter sba or lender legal rights remedies or responsibilities or impose additional duties are not acceptable
examples include provisions that require sba lender to release or waive their legal rights remedies or claims against the seller an oil company or other person subordinate the sba lender lien indemnify the seller an oil company or any other person notice
provide the seller an oil company or any other person with special notice of default or foreclosure or forbearance
provide the oil company or another person with an exclusive period of time effective date january sop f subpart in which to decide what action to take before sba lender can initiate liquidation activities in the event of default on the sba loan
questions on sba franchise policy requests for reconsideration and appeals iii
questions on sba franchise policy should be directed to local field counsel center counsel sba chief franchise counsel

certain issues involving businesses that may be engaged in promoting religion or that may have activities of prurient nature may be referred to the associate general counsel for litigation for decision
the small business applicant must demonstrate need for guaranty on the loan
the small business applicant need for the loan is determined by applying the credit
the purpose of the credit elsewhere test is to determine if the small business applicant along with its principals have the ability to obtain some or all of the requested loan funds from alternative sources without causing undue hardship
the lender must determine that the small business applicant is unable to obtain the loan on reasonable terms without federal government guaranty and some or the entire loan is not available from any of the following sources ii
the resources of the applicant business or the personal resources of the principals of the applicant business
if some or the entire loan applied for is otherwise available on reasonable terms from any of these sources the loan application must be reduced or declined
the lender must substantiate the factors that prevent the financing from being accomplished without sba support and retain the explanation in their loan file
the file must contain documentation that specifically identifies the factors in the present financing that meet the credit
acceptable factors that demonstrate an identifiable weakness in the credit or exceed policy limits of the lender include among others effective date january sop f subpart a the business needs longer maturity than the lender policy permits for example the business needs loan that is not on demand basis b the requested loan exceeds either the lender legal lending limit or policy limit regarding the amount that it can lend to one customer the lender liquidity depends upon selling the guaranteed portion of the loan on the secondary market the collateral does not meet the lender policy requirements the lender policy normally does not allow loans to new businesses or businesses in the applicant industry and or any other factors relating to the credit that in the lender opinion cannot be overcome except for the guaranty
these other factors must be specifically documented in the loan file
unacceptable factors include to address the lender community reinvestment act cra compliance or to refinance debt already on reasonable terms
the lender must certify that credit is not otherwise available by signing the lender official block on the appropriate application form
utilization of personal resources
as part of the credit elsewhere test sba requires the personal resources of any owner of or more of the small business applicant be reviewed
the rule also applies to each person when the combined ownership of the spouses and dependent children is or more
if the small business applicant is owned by trust the rule applies to the trustor
all donors to the trust will be deemed to have trustor status for eligibility purposes
the utilization of personal resources rule does not apply to the business resources of an associate or affiliated business
once it is determined that an individual owner is subject to the utilization of personal resources rule his or her percentage of ownership has no effect on the amount of the required injection
personal resources of spouses and dependent children
the sba lending programs qualify as special purpose credit programs under the equal credit opportunity act ecoa
this regulation stipulates that information pertaining to the applicant marital status sources of personal income alimony child support and spouse financial resources can be obtained and considered in determining program eligibility
therefore the lender has the right to obtain the signature of an applicant spouse whether an owner of the business or not or other person on an application or credit instrument if it is required by federal or state law
unless there is legal impediment to access the personal resources of the spouse such as those held by an independent trustee of an irrevocable trust six months or older or legal separation adjudicated by court the applicant is presumed to have access to the personal resources of his her spouse and minor children
effective date january sop f subpart agreements are not considered legal impediment
the personal resources of close relatives excluding spouse and dependent children including children above the age of majority living in the household are not considered to be available to the applicant for injection into the business
sba or the lender can require injection of the available personal resources of the individual minor children
sba or the lender cannot require the injection of the spouse personal resources but can determine that the applicant is ineligible because of access to personal resources
liquid assets only liquid assets are subject to being injected into the project this includes liquid assets held in revocable trust
liquid assets include cash ii
certificates of deposit iii
marketable securities and bonds iv
cash surrender value of life insurance and similar assets
lenders should consider carefully the transfer of assets or other actions of the applicant to avoid compliance with the intent of this provision

individual retirement accounts iras
b keoghs or other established retirement accounts subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties health savings accounts tax advantaged educational savings accounts such as accounts and other similar assets equity in real estate or other fixed assets or iii
assets pledged as security on debt obtained over months prior to the loan application
the dollar value of the pledged liquid assets that exceeds the amount of the debt being secured is considered liquid asset
utilization of personal resources rule cfr the lender must determine the overall dollar value of the allowable exemption which is defined as the amount of personal resources that do not have to be injected into the business
the allowable exemption is determined on the basis of the total financing package
the total financing package includes the sba loan together with any other loans equity injection or business funds used or arranged for at the same general time for the same project as the sba loan
if the total financing package is or less the exemption is two times the total financing package or whichever is greater ii
is between and the exemption is one and one half times the total financing package or whichever is greater or
effective date january sop f subpart iii
exceeds the exemption is one times the total financing package or whichever is greater
once the exemption is determined it is subtracted from the liquid assets
if the result is positive that amount must be injected into the project

the lender loan analysis must document and justify that the asset being refinanced has useful life at least as long as the maturity provided
the maximum maturity for loan used to refinance business acquisition shall be years unless the largest percentage of the small business assets is real estate which would permit maturity up to years
sba express and export express maximum maturities and the use of non financial default provisions
sba express and export express loans must have stated maturity and the maturities are the same as any other a loan except that revolving loans are limited to maximum maturity of years including any term out period
for export express transactional lines of credit the maximum term is years and no disbursement can be made for an export transaction where payment by the foreign buyer will occur after the maturity date of the loan
non financial default provisions are allowed under sba express and export express under the following conditions non financial default provisions are loan conditions that if violated would cause the loan to be in default even though the borrower has made all payments as agreed
non financial default provisions must be substantive and must be agreed to by the borrower in writing at loan closing the provisions must be consistent with those used by lender on its similarly sized non sba guaranteed commercial loans lender may not request purchase of the guaranty solely based on violation of non financial default provision see cfr and maturity date must be established in the note

maturity of caplines
with the above noted exception for builder caplines the maximum maturity on capline is years
any capline with maturity of less than years can be renewed as long as the total revolving repayment period does not exceed months
the renewal is an extension of maturity not new loan
thus the loan number remains the same
if the original maturity was for months or less and the new maturity exceeds months an additional guaranty fee will be due
see paragraph g of this chapter
maturity of ewcp loans
general the maximum maturity of an ewcp loan is months
sba guaranty remains in effect for disbursements made through the maturity date subject to the terms and conditions of the loan authorization and loan documents
with the exception of disbursement made to fund drawing against letter of credit that was issued under the ewcp before the maturity date disbursements made after the maturity date are not covered under the guaranty
the maturity of the loan is the date specified in the loan authorization
such date will not be longer than months from the note date
if the loan is not reissued or extended all outstanding amounts are due and payable on that day
standby letters of credit
unless sba provides prior written consent standby letters of credit supported by an ewcp loan must expire before the loan maturity date
if the lender receives sba prior written consent and makes disbursement after the maturity date because there has been draw on standby letter of credit which was issued under the ewcp prior to the maturity date such disbursement will be covered by the guaranty
specific types of ewcp loans
single transaction specific loan non revolving loan that supports specifically identified single export transaction
while the term of transaction specific loan typically should not exceed year sba may on case by case basis approve longer loan term up to months to allow for an extended production cycle
transaction based revolving line of credit revolving line of credit can support either multiple export transactions or single specifically identified export transaction on continuous basis during the term of the loan
while the term of revolving line of credit typically does not exceed year sba may allow an initial commitment up to months with annual renewals
asset based loans abls
abls are revolving lines of credit supported by monthly borrowing base certificate which reports levels of assets normally accounts receivable and inventory supporting the loan amount
abls are typically committed for months and re issued annually
because re issuance of loan is new loan another guaranty fee is due each time the loan is re issued
see the effective date january sop f subpart discussion of guaranty fees in paragraph of this chapter
abls however can have up to month maturity with annual renewals
the lender must supply to sba updated financial statements on the borrower annually
iv interest rates general policy on interest rates cfr
loan may have fixed or variable interest rate
the maximum interest rate that may be established for any a loan is governed by sba regulations on interest rates which preempts any provisions of state constitution or law
the lender negotiates the interest rate with the small business applicant subject to sba maximum rates
sba will periodically publish the maximum allowable fixed interest rate in the federal register
the maximum allowable fixed interest rate will be based on the cost of converting floating rate note to fixed rate note using the libor swap rate
for listing of the current maximum allowable fixed interest rates see www sba gov for lenders
the maximum allowable fixed rate may only be used by lender if such rate will be in effect for the entire term of the loan without adjustment or reset
otherwise the maximum rates for variable rate loans will apply
for variable interest rate loans the base rate in effect on the first business day of the month will determine the basis for the initial interest rate for any complete loan application received by sba during that month
the initial note rate must not exceed sba maximum interest rate
the basis for the sba maximum interest rate is an acceptable base rate plus allowable spread
the spread above the base rate as identified in the note may not be changed during the life of the loan without the written agreement of the borrower
for further discussion of variable interest rates see paragraph below
default interest rates are not permitted except as described below for sba express and export express
for loans with variable interest rate the following terms must be defined
base rate for standard a clp and plp loans there are three acceptable base rates a the prime rate b one month london interbank offered rate libor plus percentage points libor base rate or the sba optional peg rate
the prime or libor base rate will be that rate which is in effect on the first business day of the month as identified in national financial newspaper or website
this rate may be found in the newspaper on the second business day of the month
if website is used please ensure whether it is publishing the current day rate or the previous day rate as some newspaper websites publish the previous day rate
the optional peg rate is weighted average of rates the federal government pays for loans with maturities similar to the average a loan
sba calculates and publishes the optional peg rate effective date january sop f subpart quarterly in the federal register
base rates will be rounded to two digits with being rounded down and being rounded up
for sba express and export express in addition to the above rates lender may use the same base rate of interest it uses on its similar non sba loans with one exception
if the loan is sold in the secondary market only the base rates identified in the above paragraph are permitted
frequency of change range of fluctuation and ceiling and floor if any
after approval and prior to final disbursement lender must notify the lgpc of any changes to the note terms related to the interest rate
after final disbursement lender must notify the appropriate commercial loan servicing center of any changes to the note terms related to the interest rate

for loans with an original maturity less than years the maximum allowable rate cannot exceed percentage points over the prime rate
for loans with an original maturity of years or longer the maximum allowable rate cannot exceed percentage points over the prime rate
the spread as identified in the note may not be changed during the life of the loan without the written agreement of the borrower
lenders are permitted to add an additional percentage point to the maximum interest rate listed above for those loans greater than but not more than
lenders are permitted to add an additional percentage points to the maximum interest rate listed above for those loans of or less
the lender must designate on its application for guaranty the amount of the percentage spread to be added to the base rate at each adjustment date
policy on variable interest rates
standard policy sba maximum allowable interest rate applies only to the initial note rate on variable rate loan
subsequent increases due to change in the base rate are not subject to the maximum rate at the time of loan application
however the maximum spread over the base cannot exceed sba stated maximum
post approval changes to the interest rate
effective date january sop f subpart a
pre disbursement changes
after loan approval and prior to first disbursement the lender may change the initial note rate including changing the base rate the spread over the base rate or from fixed rate to variable rate or from variable rate to fixed rate provided the new interest rate does not exceed the maximum allowable interest rate at the time of the loan application
the lender must obtain the borrower written agreement and must notify the lgpc of the change or make the change through tran servicing
for example an sba guaranteed loan was approved with variable rate
since the loan was approved there have been changes to the prime rate
the borrower has asked the lender if it can switch to fixed rate
the answer is yes as long as the loan has not been disbursed and the fixed rate selected does not exceed the maximum allowable fixed rate at the time of loan application
post disbursement changes
after the loan is disbursed on variable rate loan the lender may change the base rate or the spread over the base rate as long as the new base rate or spread is based on method permitted when the loan was approved and is consistent with the interest rate regulations at the time the loan was approved
the lender must obtain the borrower written agreement and must notify the appropriate sba clsc of the change or make the change through tran servicing
for further guidance see the sop
frequency of interest rate adjustment
the first adjustment may occur on the first calendar day of the month following initial disbursement using the base rate in effect on the first business day of the month
lenders may delay the initial adjustment period
for example lenders have used periods as long as years in order to provide the borrower with an interest rate that is set for the first years of the loan
after that time the interest rate will begin to fluctuate as stated in the authorization
the lender must specify in the note the frequency at which the interest rate adjustment will occur
this adjustment period as identified in the note may not be changed without the written agreement of the borrower
subsequent adjustments may occur no more frequently than monthly
all subsequent adjustments will set the interest rate on the first calendar day of the adjustment period using the base rate in effect on the first business day of the adjustment period
the rate of interest will change on the first calendar day of the adjustment period even though the rate may not be known until the second business day of that period
for example if the first of the month is sunday the base rate is the prime rate in effect on monday
this rate will be reported in the wall street journal on tuesday the third calendar day and second business day of the month
many lenders use the calendar quarter as the adjustment period especially those that sell the guaranteed portion in the secondary market
after the interest rate begins fluctuating the loan can be re amortized
typically loans are re amortized every time the interest rate is adjusted to ensure full amortization by the maturity date
effective date january sop f subpart
interest rate ceilings and floors sba will permit lender to limit the upward and downward adjustments by establishing floor and ceiling provided that both the floor and ceiling are stated in the note and the difference between the stated rate in the note and the floor is equal to or greater than the difference between the stated rate in the note and the ceiling
for example if the note rate is and the ceiling is the floor must be or lower
accrual method sba does not require specific accrual method unless the loan is sold in the secondary market
loans sold on the secondary market must either use or actual as the interest accrual methods
while the interest accrual method is permitted on loans not sold on the secondary market lenders are cautioned that they cannot use this accrual method and charge the maximum allowable rate of interest because this will result in an annual percentage rate that exceeds sba regulatory maximum
amortization lender should use an amortization schedule that is appropriate for the type of loan
fixed interest rate loan must use payment that will fully amortize the loan by the maturity date
typically variable rate loans are re amortized every time the interest rate is adjusted to ensure full amortization by the maturity date
the amortization schedule may be adjusted to meet the cash flow needs of the business
fixed and variable rate combinations the lender may use fixed rate on either the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion and variable rate on the other portion of the loan
sba allows such combinations as long as each rate does not exceed the sba maximum interest rate
lender may use this structure to make loan that permits it to retain variable interest rate on the unguaranteed portion and sell fixed rate guaranteed portion on the secondary market
this reduces the volatility of the borrower interest rate
interest rate swap contracts
an interest rate swap is contract between two parties where one party pays fee in exchange for an agreement by the other party to pay any interest in excess of an established amount
the contract may last for all or part of the term of the loan
the swap contract only relates to the payment of interest
borrower has prime plus interest rate on variable rate guaranteed loan presently
the borrower could purchase an interest rate swap contract that would set the interest rate at
when the note rate is lower than the rate paid by the borrower on the swap contract the swap seller keeps the extra amount as compensation for the risk that rates will at some point exceed effective date january sop f subpart
in order to use an interest rate swap in the a program the interest rate swap
when the note rate is higher than the rate paid by the borrower on the swap contract the borrower would continue to pay the fixed rate of and the swap seller would pay the difference above to the lender
the ability to stabilize the amount of the loan payment each month is the benefit to the borrower of an interest rate swap contract
contract must meet the following conditions the interest rate swap contract is an agreement between the small business borrower and the lender or if the swap seller is not the lender third party
sba is not party to the interest rate swap contract
the interest rate swap contract does not affect the amount of money owed by the borrower to sba in the event sba purchases the guaranty
in the event of borrower default interest will be calculated using the base rate and spread in the variable interest rate note not the swap contract
sba will not be responsible if the swap seller defaults during the life of the contract
the borrower will be liable for the interest as required in the note
loans with accompanying interest rate swap contracts may be sold on the secondary market
the lender is still required under the secondary market contract sba form to forward interest and principal pursuant to the original terms of the loan
it is the lender responsibility to work with the swap seller to make sure funds are available for submission to the fiscal and transfer agent according to the time schedule in the form
the full amount of the principal and interest required under the note must be reported by the lender on the form
sba will not review swap contracts for borrowers or provide guidance on their use
while swap contracts should not have significant impact on the cost of the loan sba will not publish any guidelines on the cost of these contracts
the borrower must sign statement acknowledging that interest will be calculated at the note rate if the swap contract is terminated
the following statement must be included in the swap contract that is executed by the borrower and the swap seller
the small business administration is not party to this contract and does not guarantee it
in the event sba is called upon to honor its guaranty to the lender the borrower debt will be determined by the terms of the note including the variable interest rate provision
i swap contracts may be used on new or existing loans
the swap contract does not have to last for the entire length of the loan agreement
sba does not have standard form for an interest rate swap contract

guaranty fee calculation for multiple loans
whenever one borrower including any affiliate receives an approval for more than one loan with maturity exceeding months within days of each other the loans will be treated as if they were one loan for purposes of determining the percentage of guaranty and for determining the amount of the guaranty fees
because the guaranty fee is based on the amount of the sba share the lender must calculate the fee based on the combined sba shares of all sba business loans to one borrower including affiliates approved within days of each other
loans with maturity of months or less are not included in this calculation
when two loans are approved within days of each other the applicable fee for the second loan will equal the amount of the fee that would have been charged had the two loans been combined less the amount of the fee on the first loan
when the applicant receives both short and long term a loan the percentage of guaranty is calculated as if the loans are combined but the guaranty fee is based solely on the maturity of each loan
effective date january sop f subpart
if short term loan that was made within days of long term loan is renewed
and the maturity is extended beyond months the guaranty fee calculated at the time of renewal would equal the fee that would have been charged if both loans were originally long term
the amount owed sba at the time of renewal would equal the recalculated guaranty fee less the amount paid at the time of original approval
this rule also applies to any subsequent increases to either of the loans even if one of the loans subsequently is paid in full

for all applications processed through the lgpc sba reviews the lender credit analysis at time of loan processing and may ask for and receive additional information beyond the initial submission requirements
this is because sba is making the final credit determination on these loans
sba has authorized plp sba express and export express lenders to make credit decisions without sba review prior to loan approval
the plp sba express and export express lender analysis is subject to sba review and determination of adequacy however when the lender requests sba to purchase its guaranty or when sba is conducting lender oversight activities
equityrequirement for loans in excess of

the lender must determine if the equity and the pro forma debt to worth are acceptable based on the factors related to that type of business experience of the management and the level of competition in the market area
the lender must include in its credit analysis detailed discussion of the required equity and its adequacy
source of equity injection the following may be considered as equity injection cash that is not borrowed
cash that is borrowed only under the limited circumstances outlined below
sba considers funds borrowed through the use of personal credit for injection into the business as additional debt not equity with one exception
if the small business applicant can demonstrate repayment of this personal loan from sources other than the cash flow of the business the cash injection may be considered equity
note the salary of the business owner does not qualify
lender must disclose any loan made to an individual for the purpose of providing an equity injection into the business
the lender credit analysis must address the impact on the personal and business balance sheets and sources of repayment for such side loans
if the sba participating lender is providing the personal loan the lender must submit the application for guaranty through standard a processing
assets other than cash lenders must carefully evaluate the value of assets other than cash that are injected by owners or principals

copy of the note must be attached to the standby agreement
see chapter paragraph iv of this subpart for additional discussion of standby agreements
the following may not be considered as equity injection value or cost of education and effective date january sop f subpart ii
funds that are borrowed and do not meet the exception noted in subparagraph above
documentation of equity injection
lenders must verify the injection prior to disbursing loan proceeds and must maintain evidence of such verification in their loan files
lenders are expected to use reasonable and prudent efforts to verify that equity is injected and used as intended and failure to do so may warrant repair or partial full denial
lenders must submit with each purchase request on loan for which the loan authorization required an equity injection documentation to show that they verified the equity injection
verifying cash injection requires the following documentation copy of check or wire transfer along with evidence that the check or wire was processed showing the funds were moved into the borrower account or escrow ii
copy of the statements of account for the account from which the funds are being withdrawn for each of the two most recent months prior to disbursement showing that the funds were available and iii

an it loan can be secured by second lien position on the property or equipment financed by the it loan or on other assets of the small business concern if the sba determines that the second lien provides adequate assurance of repayment of the loan
for example when the it loan is to improve business real estate such as financing an addition to an existing building or to purchase equipment and the collateral securing the it loan is subject to first lien securing an existing loan used to acquire the business real estate or equipment the it loan may be in second lien position if the loan in the first lien position was not made at or about the same time as the it loan piggyback financing and the lender analysis identifies how the risk of second lien position on the it loan is offset by other factors such as other collateral has been taken to secure the it loan that in liquidation would pay the it loan in full or the business has been operating profitably and repaying its existing obligations in timely manner and the borrower cash flow is sufficient to repay all of the borrower debt including the it loan
clear justification must exist when the interest rate for the first lien loan is significantly higher than the it loan and or the maturity of the first lien loan is significantly shorter than the it loan

cdcs must ensure that they have the correct date of the agreement that the applicant franchisee is operating under in order to access the correct registry documents
if cdc is unable to determine the date from the documents it should contact the franchisor directly
sba will accept the executed certification of franchise documents available on the registry website matching the correct year of the agreement as conclusive evidence that the franchisee is not affiliated with the franchisor based upon the agreement
affiliation may nevertheless exist based on other factors
in order to rely on the registry for its determination the cdc loan file must include the following a executed franchise agreement and any approved attachments and exhibits b executed addendum if required executed certification of franchise documents and compliance with any required eligibility notes
process if not listed on registry or cdc is not using the registry if the agreement is not listed on the registry or the cdc chooses not to use the registry review must be made of the agreement and all related documents
franchise findings cdcs should consult the sba franchise findings list at http www sba gov content franchise findings to see if there have been any findings for particular franchise agreement which if still in the agreement would result in determination of affiliation
the information provided by the sba franchise findings list should be used by cdcs to ensure they are making informed affiliation determinations
cdcs should consult the fix available

lenders must document the file with the following affidavit signed by the small business applicant that both men and women are allowed to join and or use the facility and ii
evidence that the facility is open to both men and women such as two single sex bathrooms or locker rooms brochures flyers stating that both men and women are welcome or actual membership demographics
gasoline industry based on the industry standard established by the gasoline industry it is common practice for the oil company to install credit card system to provide for payment of gasoline products
this type of arrangement by itself does not create excessive control or affiliation
most dealer agreements are for term of three years with limited or no renewal terms
in situations where gasoline supplier is leasing the real property to the dealer the petroleum marketing practices act controls and contains detailed provisions on the authority and procedure for non renewal or termination
this type of lease arrangement by itself does not place inappropriate control in the oil company dealer
the eligibility determination for all gas station loans must include review of the relevant documents
the documentation associated with gas station loans is voluminous complex and frequently contains provisions that enable an oil company or another non small person to exert significant control over the small business loan applicant resulting in affiliation cfr have significant negative impact on the marketability and collateral value of the property and impair the applicant repayment ability
therefore all relevant documents must be reviewed to determine whether single provision or based on the totality of the circumstances cfr execution of the relevant documents by the small business would render it ineligible for sba financial assistance
effective date january sop f subpart relevant documents
for purposes of this paragraph the term relevant documents includes but is not limited to the report containing the preliminary results of search of the title to the property including the documents listed in the abstract of title hereafter the title report the small business concern oil company supply agreement and convenience store franchise agreement if any and if the loan is to purchase the property all purchase and sale documents including the exhibits addendums amendments etc
hereafter the purchase and sale documents
while titles vary examples of relevant documents that must be reviewed include the real estate sale agreement terms and conditions of sale contract escrow instructions escrow agreement franchise agreement contract dealer gasoline agreement branded reseller agreement memorandum of gasoline agreement for dealer owner franchisee operated facility branded gas sales restriction and covenant special warranty deed bill of sale use restriction addendum right of first refusal agreement repurchase option subordination agreement environmental release environmental declaration environmental matters remediation and indemnification addendum and site access agreement
subordination is not sufficient to overcome the unacceptable results of objectionable provisions that are of record or to be recorded
this is because to clear the title sba lien would need to be foreclosed and doing so would prevent the small business concern from selling the gas station as going concern and significantly diminish sba recovery in the event of default
examples of unacceptable document review findings i affiliation
provisions in the relevant documents that give an oil company or another non small person significant control over the small business applicant are not acceptable
examples include purchase or repurchase options
purchase or repurchase options that allow an oil company or other person to acquire the small business concern primary business asset g real estate if the small business concern violates condition covenant restriction or other provision
distinction purchase option is different from right of first refusal
right of first refusal that allows an oil company or other person to match third party offer is generally acceptable to sba
please note that right of first refusal on partial transfer of an interest in the small business concern is not acceptable deed use restrictions
provisions that give an oil company or other person the right to record deed or use restrictions that enable the oil company or other person to control the use of the property thereby preventing the small business owner from fully benefiting commensurate with ownership
note that certain deed restrictions pertaining to the use of the property which are effective date january sop f subpart intended to protect the health and safety of occupants may be acceptable
examples of uses in deed restrictions based upon environmental concerns which may be acceptable may include residential use use as day care center for children or seniors use as school or use as hospital
ii significant impairment of collateral value or repayment ability
provisions in the relevant documents that impose requirements restrictions or consequences that could significantly impair the collateral value and marketability of the property or the small business concern repayment ability are not acceptable
the fact that the collateral will consist solely of personal property such as buildings and trade fixtures located on leased land is irrelevant since they would ordinarily be sold in place in the event of foreclosure g a carwash mini mart or fuel pumping equipment
examples include deed restrictions covenants easements reversionary interests and other provisions that restrict the use of the property for the benefit of the seller an oil company or any other person such as those that restrict the brand of fuel that can be sold on the property or require subsequent owners of the property to indemnify an oil company or other person and engineering controls that require the small business concern or subsequent owners to install costly devices or structures such as extraction wells or subsurface barrier walls prior to constructing building remodeling or otherwise improving the property

on site dry cleaning facilities which may have utilized tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce in the course of their business operations may present significant clean up costs if these contaminants have entered the soil or groundwater
prudent lending practices dictate and sba requires that on site dry cleaners in operation for more than five years undergo phase ii environmental site assessment in addition to phase which would be required due to the naics code match
any phase ii performed in connection with an on site dry cleaning facility must be conducted by an independent environmental professional who holds current professional engineer or professional geologist license and has the equivalent of three years of full time relevant experience

the gross debenture cannot exceed for each small business concern which includes any prior sba loan guaranties committed or outstanding or to the applicant and its affiliates for regular loans and ii
public policy projects see section ii of the sbi act and chapter of this subpart eligibility
each project for small manufacturers defined as business with its primary naics code in sectors and and all of its production facilities are located in the united states ii
each project that reduces the borrower energy consumption by at least or iii
each project for plant equipment and process upgrades of renewable energy sources such as the small scale production of energy for individual buildings or communities consumption commonly known as micropower or renewable fuel producers including biodiesel and ethanol producers
there can be more than one project for small manufacturers and eligible energy projects for the same applicant or for its affiliates provided that sba determines that each project meets prudent lending standards
the per project is not reduced by other prior sba loan amounts outstanding because the is limit per project not limit for each small business concern
note loans made for projects for small manufacturers or eligible energy loans as described above do not reduce the limit for each small business concern for regular loans and loans for public policy projects
determining sba share of the project costs to price debenture you must determine sba share of project total cost

separate payment of the debenture fees
if the borrower chooses to pay the cdc processing fee upfront the borrower
the cdc processing fee and the closing costs are the only fees that can be paid upfront and deleted from the gross debenture calculations
may be reimbursed for the cdc processing fee from the debenture proceeds
if the borrower is reimbursed the cdc processing fee will be included in calculating the gross debenture
the cdc will receive the fee as usual
the cdc then must reimburse the borrower
if the borrower does not want to be reimbursed for the cdc processing fee from the debenture proceeds the gross debenture calculation must include the cdc processing fee in order to determine the correct underwriter fee
once the underwriter fee is calculated zero is then entered on the cdc processing fee line in the sba form and the dollar amounts are re totaled and rounded to the next higher thousand for the new gross debenture amount
when the debenture is priced if the borrower does not use the full amount of any contingency fund then the
debenture is priced at time of application
if there are any changes in the portion of the project costs between loan approval and project completion the debenture must be re priced
debenture may be re priced as follows if the amount of the unused contingency fund is or less of the approved gross debenture amount the difference must be refunded to the borrower from the gross debenture proceeds by the csa
no change is needed in the debenture amount and this does not require loan modification request
if the amount of the unused contingency fund is greater than of the approved gross debenture amount the cdc must request loan modification from the slpc prior to closing to reduce the net debenture proceeds by the amount of the unused contingency fund and the debenture amount is recalculated
